# nanoda

`nanoda` is a simple Rust benchmarking tool for memory access patterns.
Its name comes from the catchphrase "nanoda(なのだ)" of **Zundamon (ずんだもん)**, a character in **VoiceVox**.

## Features

- Unsafe uninitialized boxed slices for high-performance memory allocation
- Permutation-based memory access (custom LCG per pointer width)
- Per-iteration nanosecond timing using `quanta::Clock`
- Configurable memory size (`-n`) and iteration count (`-i`)

## Usage

```bash
cargo run --release -- -n <memory in MiB> -i <iterations>
````

Example:

```bash
cargo run --release -- -n 512 -i 5
```

Output:

```
min = 12.345 ns, max = 67.890 ns, avg = 34.567 ns
```
